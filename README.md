# Conversation.one Import

This is a script to dynamically insert code into an archive from conversation.one and repack the archive. The repacked archive can then be imported back into the conversation.one project.

## Features

### Custom Intent Code

Custom code for handling an intent can be included using the following syntax:

```js
// import yourCustomCodeFile.js
// end yourCustomCodeFile.js
```

The script will insert the contents of `yourCustomCodeFile.js` between the tags. Because of the ending and closing tags, this feature is idempotent.

## Usage

### Requirements

A Unix environment with Python 3 installed and accessible from `PATH`.

### Workflow

#### Export

First export your conversation.one project using the "Export All Rules" option.

![Export All Rules](/docs/images/Export.png)

#### Process

Then run the script, passing in the archive you just created.

```
./import.py path/to/exported/archive.zip output.zip
```

#### Import

Now you can import the archive back in to your project by uploading the `output.zip` file created by the script.
